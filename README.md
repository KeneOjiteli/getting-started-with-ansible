# Ansible Introduction: Running ad hoc command and deploying a site on 2 virtual machines.

In this article, I will demo how to use ad hoc commands (a quick way to run a task on one or more managed nodes) and how to use ansible playbook to install an application on a virtual machine.

**Prerequisites**

- A cloud provider (Azure with an active subscription) - to create virtual machines.
- An SSH client (I will be using Mobaxterm) to SSH into my VMs.
